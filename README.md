Title: Predictive Parsing LL(1) Algorithm in C

Description:
This C program implements the predictive parsing LL(1) algorithm, which is a top-down parsing technique commonly used in compiler construction and formal language theory. Predictive parsing LL(1) is characterized by having one token of lookahead and using a parsing table to predict the production rule to apply based on the current non-terminal symbol and the next input token.

Features:
- Implements LL(1) predictive parsing algorithm in C.
- Defines a grammar with non-terminals, terminals, and production rules.
- Initializes a parsing table based on the LL(1) grammar rules.
- Parses input strings according to the LL(1) parsing table.
- Outputs whether each input string is accepted or rejected based on the grammar rules.

Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Input strings will be parsed according to the LL(1) grammar rules, and the program will output whether each input string is accepted or rejected.

This program serves as a simple demonstration of how LL(1) predictive parsing works and can be used as a reference for understanding parsing techniques in compiler construction. It can be extended or modified to support different grammars and parsing requirements.
